          <h2>Correlation Discovered Between Lack of Health Care and Poverty</h2>
          <p>According to data taken from the American Census Survey for 2014, there is a strong correlation between a state's
            overall healthcare coverage percentage and the state's overall level of poverty.</p>

          <p>An examination of the graphic above reveals that as a state's lack of health insurance increases, they also tend to
            have higher levels of poverty.  Exceptions to this trend include Washington D.C., West Virginia and Kentucky, all 
            with higher levels of health care coverage yet higher than average percentage of their populations in poverty.  One
            similarity between these "states" is their small population size, making it easier for those locations to have more
            localized version of health care (DC), or when they are employed largely in agricultural and manufacturing jobs (West
            Virginia and Kentucky), they are unionized with access to healthcare through their employer.  More analysis of 
            unemployment rates would be needed to see if employment, and its wages, is not keeping pace with cost increases in
            these areas.  In almost no other states is the extent of the difference between these two factors greater than 10%.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the greatest success story of why states should move to a healthcare for all model is Massachusetts.  Massachusetts
            implemented its requirement for all residents to have health care in 2007, along with its MassHealth exchange, and the 
            results appear to speak for themselves: they have some of the lowest poverty rates in the country.  More analysis is 
            needed to determine whether there are additional factors such as higher minimum wages or government services that perhaps
            help workers not fall into poverty.</p>
